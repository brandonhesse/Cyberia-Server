### About Cyberia
Cyberia is tool for independent groups to privately host play sessions in an organized manner, supporting a small to medium number of participants over any connection. The goal is to support cell phones and browsers in a way that will provide intuitive means for Role Players to meet, keep track of sessions, switch between multiple characters without loging out, edit previous posts, and find other players within a community.
